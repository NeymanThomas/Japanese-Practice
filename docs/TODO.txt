TODO
=============================================
3 Add a new stat that tracks the total amount of time spent practicing
4 Make it so you can see your high scores on the stats screen without having to actually do a challenge
- Add a different sound for searching a word in the dictionary
2* update the saving system. It should just go into one big save file
1 Make sure the same word can't appear in a row when practicing
2* Add save file for user preferences like their settings
2* When deleting stats, just wipe the stats, don't delete the file
IMPORTANT
- On releases, instead of having the whole folder there, upload the zip so it is easier to access for people without github
