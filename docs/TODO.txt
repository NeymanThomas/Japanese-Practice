TODO
=============================================
- Add a new stat that tracks the total amount of time spent practicing
- have the word be automatically entered into the chat challenge mode when it is spelled instead of needing to hit enter
- Display the mistakes in various gradients of colors so bigger mistakes stand out
- Add the phrases or vocabulary section
IMPORTANT
- On releases, instead of having the whole folder there, upload the zip so it is easier to access for people without github
