TODO
=============================================
- fill out all dictionaries
- Add a new stat that tracks the total amount of time spent practicing
- Make it so you can see your high scores on the stats screen without having to actually do a challenge
- Add a pronunciation option for the dictionary so if the user doesn't know how to pronounce the kanji, they can see
- update the saving system. It should just go into one big save file
- Make sure the same word can't appear in a row when practicing
- Add a 'pronunciation' button in the vocabulary sections
- Add save file for user preferences like their settings
- have the word be automatically entered into the chat challenge mode when it is spelled instead of needing to hit enter
- Display the mistakes in various gradients of colors so bigger mistakes stand out
IMPORTANT
- On releases, instead of having the whole folder there, upload the zip so it is easier to access for people without github
