# Japanese Practice
This project is a Japanese language learning practice tool built using the Unity engine. It helps users practice very basic concepts like Hiragana (ひらがな), Katakana (カタカナ) and some basic Kanji (感じ) and phrases. Users can practice memorizing how to pronounce the various symbols, and memorize which symbol represents various romanji. Users are also able to test their skills in the challenge mode where they can gain points by identifying the correct pronunciation in the given time.
